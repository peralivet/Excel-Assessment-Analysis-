## Overview

This project contains data and analysis scripts for tracking and reporting on employee headcount data across multiple months. The data is provided in separate tabs, 
with each tab representing the month-end headcount for the respective month. The excel data will be attached in a separate file.

The main objectives of this project are:

1. Compile the data in a meaningful way to facilitate tracking and reporting.
2. Prepare views and visualizations for the following:
  - Headcount split by month
  - Number of employees currently on leave
  - Graphical view of headcount numbers by location and month
  - Count of leavers (terminations) per month
  - Additional helpful graphs or charts
3. Analyze the latest month's headcount (June 2023) to provide the following insights:
  - Current number of staff per department
  - Staff distribution by length of service (banded view)
  - Headcount by gender split
  - Headcount by ethnicity split

This was an assessment by a company I applied for a job and they wanted me to use Excel to solve this problem, which I did but also wanted to use PowerBI as well.
